*too much for one person to manage alone*

Please do help me. I come in peace.

I'm not trying to lose friends or developer friends over this or hurt feelings. 

I'm just being honest, open, and willing to advance webOS through my current, past, and future projects.

THIS IS *MY GOAL*. Period.

If you can help, please star and fork it. I'll do the  rest in a lil bit.


Thanks to all!

Join the official Neo_webOS channel on IRC for password WEBOS. I'll try to remove the password later. Stuck here now.
