				Woah there.
			</h1>
			<p>
				You've landed on this page because you're using an old version of Internet Explorer.
				<br /><br />
				See, the problem is, Internet Explorer doesn't follow web standards.  So, this whole site? 
				It doesn't load. Like, at all. It looks really, really awful.  That's really too bad. I've 
				taken lots of time to do some <strong>really</strong> cool things with stylesheets and the 
				like.  If you keep using Internet Explorer, you just won't be able to see any of this stuff.
				<br /><br />
				It's not a total loss, though.  There are plenty of options out there that follow these 
				standards.  Take Chrome and Firefox, for example.  They're two excellent examples of browsers 
				that can do all the really neat stuff that I've put into this site.  Do yourself a favor, 
				and download one or the other.  You'll be really happy you did, when you can see just how 
				amazing the internet can look.
