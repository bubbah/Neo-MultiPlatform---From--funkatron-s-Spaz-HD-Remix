This is everything Jake and I have done / modified to Neo including past and present changes.
Please, for the love of god, don't pirate this.
Please. I'm begging you. This is mine. My package. Sellouts.
I reserve the right to modify the licence to this package at any time.
That's my personal right.
If you have legal liabilities, take it up with a counselor.
I'll find a lean and it's my right to save my code to myself and upload when ready.
I'm doing this as a FAVOR TO THE ENTIRE WEBOS COMMUNITY.
Let's #SavewebOS for LeoDarts baby.
